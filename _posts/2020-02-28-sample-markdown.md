The application allows users to create groups and add expenses, which are automatically divided among the group members.
"Racha" is a Brazilian slang term for "splitting the bill". It is a common practice in Brazil for friends to divide the bill when dining out or having drinks. "Rachadinha" is a diminutive form of "racha" and is not intended to remind you of any political scandals, as you may find when searching for the term on Google (ðŸ˜…). We also encourage you to look at the [code repository](https://github.com/guilhXavier/agile-project-3a).
